Just testing my push action ... I want to send this to edknorr/test-repo/ at GitHub:

https://github.com/edknorr/test-repo

... as a bunch of testing for my Coursera R Data Science Toolbox assignment.

(I had trouble with this from git, so I'm getting extra practice after following the 
course discussion board, of which I've made a copy.  See git_push_forum_instructions.docx.)
